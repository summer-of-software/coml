COML
====

Course Outline Markup Language (COML) is an XML vocabulary for creating and managing course
outlines. It was intended to be used at Vermont Technical College to store and process outlines
for all of the college's courses. However, it was never put into service.

The folder `Outlines` contains sample COML outlines based on some (possibly old) versions of VTC
courses. The folder `Outlier` is a Java program for manipulating course outlines and computing
various things about them. It is nothing more than a proof-of-concept application right now. The
`doc` folder contains some documentation related to the course outline project including a
(possibly old) version of the outline standard that defines the schema of the outline instance
documents.

The file `COML.xsl` is a style sheet for formatting outlines for web display. The file
`COML.xsn` is an InfoPath form to simplify the task of creating outlines for non-experts.
